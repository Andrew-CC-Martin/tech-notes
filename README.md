A few notes to myself:

- The directories for each language should be more focused towards the language itself. Fixes for bugs should mostly go in the `bug-fix` directory.
	- If I fix a bug using a language feature, put the whole details in `bug-fix`, then put the language feature in the relevant language directory.
- `tech-support` is more for stuff like general OS/gui app/hardware issues.
